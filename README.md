# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Frontend Documentation

## Tech Stack

The frontend of this application is built using the following technologies:

- **Vite:** A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It serves as the foundation of our build process.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to build reusable UI components and manage the state of our application.
- **React-Router-Dom:** A collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
- **@reduxjs/toolkit:** The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **@tanstack/react-query:** A library for fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in React applications.
- **Flowbite & Flowbite-React:** A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **@mantine/core & @mantine/hooks & @mantine/form:** A React components and hooks library with native dark theme support focused on usability, accessibility and developer experience.
- **Lottie-React:** A mobile library for Android and iOS that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as JSON with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile and on the web.
- **React-Hot-Toast:** Smoking hot Notifications for React. Show, hide or update a toast on the fly. Works great with react-hot-toast.
- **React-Icons:** Include popular icons in your React projects easily with react-icons, which utilizes ES6 imports that allows you to include only the icons that your project is using.

## Folder Structure

Here are some of the key directories in the frontend:

- **src:** This is the main directory where all the source code of the application lives. All the components, hooks, services, and utilities are defined here.
- **src/assets:** This directory contains all the static files like images, SVGs, and global styles.
- **src/components:** This directory contains all the React components.
- **src/hooks:** This directory contains all the custom hooks used across the application.
- **src/services:** This directory contains all the services that interact with the backend API.
